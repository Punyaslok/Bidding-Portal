BUG 1 : Live Search Bar fails to work properly on an individual product's page. Works fine on home and sell pages.

BUG 2 : Live Bidding Information is displayed ONLY after the first bid is placed. It doesn't change from 0 bids to 1 bid. But if the page initially has >=1 bids, it works correctly. ex - if 4th bid is being displayed and a new bid, is made, the bid value will change to the 5th bid.
